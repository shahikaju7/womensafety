        <h1> PRACTICE AWARENESS </h1>
         <p> The first, and probably most important, component in self-defense is awareness: awareness of yourself, your surroundings, and your potential attacker’s likely strategies.
        </p>
         <h1> USE YOUR SIXTH SENSE </h1> 
         <p>Learn to trust this power and use it to your full advantage. Avoid a person or a situation that does not “feel” safe — you’re probably right</p>
          <h1>TAKE SELF-DEFENSE TRAINING <h1>
          <p>The self-defense program should include simulated assaults**, with a fully padded instructor in realistic rape and attack scenarios, to allow you to practice what you’ve learned.
          </p>
         <h1>YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO FIGHT </h1> 
         <p> it is important to understand that you CAN and SHOULD defend yourself physically. You have both the moral and legal right to do so, even if the attacker is only threatening you and hasn’t struck first.
          </p>
          <h1> PEPPER SPRAY IS NOT YOUR SECRET WEAPON </h1>
          <p> Never depend on any self-defense tool or weapon to stop an attacker. Trust your body and your wits, which you can always depend on in the event of an attack.

        <p>We are living in the worst time our modern society has ever seen in terms of women security. Our aim is to make women feel as strong as ever, strong enough to fight the parasites of our society, strong enough to fight the odds, strong enough to protect themselves against any sexual assaults. We aim at giving power to those without whom we cease to exist. Our idea is to design a website to aware  women about their rigits.
